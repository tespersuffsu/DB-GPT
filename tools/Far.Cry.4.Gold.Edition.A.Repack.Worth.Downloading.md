## How to Master the Gameplay of Far Cry 4
 
Far Cry 4 is not just a game about shooting enemies and exploring a beautiful open world. It is also a game that requires strategy, stealth, creativity, and skill. Here are some tips and tricks that will help you get the most out of your Kyrat adventure.

1. Upgrade your Loot Bag first. As mentioned above, crafting is essential for increasing your inventory capacity and unlocking new abilities. The first thing you should craft is a bigger Loot Bag, which will allow you to carry more items, such as ammo, money, and loot. To do this, you need to hunt animals and collect their skins. You can find animals in the wild, or use bait to lure them out. Some animals are more rare and dangerous than others, so be prepared for a challenge.
2. Elephants are better than cars. One of the most fun features of Far Cry 4 is the ability to ride elephants once you unlock the Elephant Rider skill. Elephants are not only majestic and adorable, but also powerful and destructive. You can use them to charge into enemy camps and fortresses, trample soldiers and vehicles, and even throw enemies with your trunk. Elephants are also immune to fire and explosions, making them ideal for chaotic situations. Just be careful not to hurt innocent civilians or friendly rebels with your elephant rampage.
3. Animals can be useful. Besides elephants, there are many other animals that can help you in your quest. You can use bait to attract predators, such as tigers, bears, or wolves, and use them to distract or attack your enemies. You can also tame some animals with the Beast Master skill, which will allow you to command them to follow you, stay put, or attack a target. Some of the animals you can tame include leopards, snow leopards, clouded leopards, dholes, wolves, honey badgers, and black eagles. Each animal has its own strengths and weaknesses, so choose wisely.
4. Your choices will have consequences. Throughout the game, you will encounter situations where you have to make a choice between two options. These choices will affect the story, the characters, and the world of Kyrat. For example, you will have to choose between supporting Amita or Sabal, the two leaders of the Golden Path rebel group. Each one has a different vision for Kyrat's future, and your decision will determine which missions you get, which allies you make or lose, and which ending you see. There are also other choices that will have smaller but still noticeable effects on the game.
5. The Microlight Chopper is your best friend. One of the best ways to explore Kyrat is by using the Microlight Chopper, a small helicopter that you can find at some outposts or call in with a token. The chopper is fast, agile, and easy to control. You can use it to fly over mountains, rivers, and forests, scout enemy locations from above, drop bombs or grenades on unsuspecting foes, or parachute out of it for a quick escape. The chopper is also great for collecting collectibles that are hard to reach otherwise.

These are just some of the tips that will help you master Far Cry 4's gameplay. There are many more things to discover and experiment with in this game, so don't be afraid to try new things and have fun.
